## What is FORbID?

With modern Fortran standards (2003+) introduction, is possible to develop a KISS and lightweight library for numerical integration of definite integrals using the new features of Object Oriented Programming like Abstract Data Type (ADT).

## Main features

FORbID is aimed to be a KISS-pure-Fortran library for numerical integration of definite integrals.

+ [ ] Pure Fortran implementation;
+ [ ] KISS and user-friendly:
    + [ ] simple API, presently based on the Rouson's Abstract Data Type Pattern [2];
    + [ ] easy building and porting on heterogeneous architectures;
+ [ ] comprehensive integrators set out-of-the-box [1]:
    + [x] Newton-Cotes interpolation formulas;
        + [x] trapezoidal rule;
        + [x] Cavalieri-Simpson's rule;
        + [x] Cavalieri-Simpson's 3/8 rule;
        + [x] Boole's rule;
        + [x] Newton-Cotes' 6 points rule;
        + [x] Newton-Cotes' 7 points rule;
        + [x] Newton-Cotes' 8 points rule;
        + [x] Newton-Cotes' 9 points rule;
        + [x] Newton-Cotes' 10 points rule;
        + [x] Newton-Cotes' 11 points rule;
    + [ ] Integration formulas of interpolatory type:
        + [ ] Fej√©r interpolation formulas;
        + [ ] Clenshaw-Curtis interpolation formulas;
    + [ ] Adaptive quadrature
        + [ ] midpoint adaptive quadrature;
        + [ ] trapezoidal adaptive quadrature;
        + [ ] Simpson's adaptive quadrature;
    + [ ] Gaussian quadrature formulae:
        + [ ] Gauss-Kronrod formulae:
        + [ ] Montecarlo schemes for multidimensional function;
        + [ ] acceleration methods;
+ [ ] efficient:
    + [ ] high scalability on parallel architectures:
        + [ ] support for shared memory multi/many cores architecture;
        + [ ] support for distributed memory cluster;
+ [ ] [Tests-Driven](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/FOODiE/wiki/Examples) Developed ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)):
+ [ ] well documented:
    + [ ] clear documentation of schemes implementations;
    + [ ] comprehensive [wiki](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/FORbID/wiki):
+ [x] collaborative developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/giacombum/FORbID);
